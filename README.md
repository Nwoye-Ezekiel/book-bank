# Book Bank

Book Bank is a React-based web application that allows users to search and explore books using [Google's Books API].

The application features infinite scrolling, providing a seamless browsing experience. Users can view detailed book information and access previews directly on the [Google Books] platform.

## Project Overview

This project is built using the following tools and technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the development of dynamic and interactive web applications.
- **TypeScript:** Provides static typing to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **Material-UI:** A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed components for building responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilizes utility-first CSS for building responsive and modern user interfaces.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests, simplifying the process of fetching data.
- **React Query:** A library for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server data in React applications, providing a powerful and efficient way to manage server state.
- **React Intersection Observer:** A React hook for observing when elements enter or leave the viewport, useful for implementing features like infinite scrolling.
- **Lodash Debounce:** A utility that limits the rate at which a function is executed, optimizing performance during repetitive actions like search input.
- **FontFaceObserver:** A library for monitoring when custom web fonts are loaded, ensuring consistent typography across the application.
- **Husky:** Ensures code quality by running linting and formatting checks before commits.
- **Lint Staged:** Runs linting and formatting tasks on staged files before committing.
- **ESLint:** Identifies and fixes problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
- **Prettier:** Formats code consistently according to a defined style.
- **Figma:** A collaborative design tool used to create user interfaces. I used it to design the logo, the app's favicon, and to experiment with various UI elements and layouts.

## Key Features

- **Book Search:** Find books based on various criteria such as title and author, using the powerful search functionality integrated with Google's Books API.
- **Explore Book Details:** View comprehensive information about each book, including title, authors, publication date, cover image, and more.
